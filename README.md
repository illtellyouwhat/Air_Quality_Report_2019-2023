# Air Quality Analysis (2019-2023)

[![AQI Visualization Preview](/images/aqi_viz-ref.png)](https://illtellyouwhat.github.io/Air_Quality_Report_2019-2023/)

**A comprehensive data engineering project demonstrating systematic data cleaning, statistical analysis, and methodical documentation of a complex analytical workflow.**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Analysis of global air quality data spanning 616 cities across 95 countries, demonstrating systematic data engineering from raw CSV imports through statistical transformation to final visualization-ready datasets.

**Key Achievement:** Transformed 24 variables of incomplete, messy air quality data into statistically normalized, WHO-guideline-referenced analysis using weighted rolling averages and composite scoring.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [World Air Quality Index COVID-19 Dataset](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/)
- **Temporal Coverage:** Q1 2019 - Q2 2023
- **Geographic Coverage:** 616 cities, 95 countries
- **Variables:** 9 pollutants + 15 weather metrics
- **Volume:** Multi-year daily measurements with city-level aggregation

---

## 🔬 Methodology Highlights

### Data Engineering
- **Completeness Threshold:** Only cities with ≥75% data coverage retained
- **Missing Data:** Linear interpolation for gaps ≤8 days
- **Quality Control:** Multi-stage validation removing erroneous measurements, duplicates, and insufficient sample sizes

### Statistical Approach
- **Weighted 30-day Rolling Averages:** Accounts for data completeness in temporal smoothing
- **Z-Score Normalization:** Both city-specific and dataset-wide for multi-scale analysis
- **Composite Magnitude Scoring:** Balances pollution exceedance frequency and amplitude

### WHO Guideline Integration
- Automated flagging of days exceeding WHO air quality thresholds
- Magnitude scoring quantifies severity of guideline violations
- Both acute (single-day) and chronic (sustained) pollution patterns identified

## 💡 What This Demonstrates

**Systems Thinking in Data Engineering:**
- Layered approach to data quality (sampling → completeness → outlier detection)
- Decision-making documented with external research backing (EPA standards, WHO guidelines)
- Methodology designed for reproducibility and transparency

**Technical Capabilities:**
- PostgreSQL for data transformation and aggregation
- Python/Pandas for interpolation and exploratory analysis
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for quality visualization
- Jupyter notebooks for process documentation
- SQL query organization for multi-stage pipeline

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
- Identified Q1 2022 data gap, adapted methodology to split analysis periods
- Discovered misplaced wind variables, systematically verified and corrected
- Used statistical methods (Z-scores) to identify remaining outliers after cleaning

## 🎓 Key Learnings

**Data Quality > Data Quantity:**
The 75% completeness threshold and 18-sample minimum meant losing cities, but ensured statistical validity of remaining analysis.

**Weighted Approaches Handle Reality:**
Simple rolling averages ignore data gaps. Weighting by completeness score produces more accurate temporal smoothing.

**Documentation = Future Efficiency:**
Comprehensive notes on why decisions were made (backed by EPA/WHO standards) makes methodology defensible and adaptable.

**Outlier Detection Requires Domain Knowledge:**
Z-scores flagged high pollution readings, but research into forest fires validated them as real events, not data errors. Statistics + context = good judgment.
